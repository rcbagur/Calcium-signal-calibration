# Calcium-signal-calibration
Matlab script to analyze Calcium Signaling experiments:
1) Calibration of the fluorescence intensity of Fura2AM (intracellular calcium indicator that is ratiometric, emission at 340nm and 380nm) to Calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]) and normalization of the fluorescence intensity of RCaMP sensor targeted to the mitochondria for its baseline.
2) Syncronization of the first Calcium peak of each cell analyzed
3) Measurement of maximal cytosolic [Ca2+] ('maxF'), mitochondrial [Ca2+] ('maxR'), uncoupling time between cytosolic signal and mitochondrial calciumuptake ('utime'), rate of cytosolic [Ca2+] rise ('velocityF') and rate of mitochondrial [Ca2+] rise ('velocityR').
